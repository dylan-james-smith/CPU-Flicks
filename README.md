## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

While I was trying to wrap things up before falling a sleep I chose the wrong autocomplete, but it didn't cause an error until trying to run the app. I knew where the error should be, but it took a very long time to finally see the typo and solve the problem. 
This was frustrating, but did make me research more and fleshed out my troubleshooting skills.
